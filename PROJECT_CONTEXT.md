# Project Context & AI Guidelines

This document provides a concise, single-source-of-truth reference for AI assistants working on **`internship-engine-india`**.

---

## 1. Project Purpose & Scope

- **Primary Goal**: Automatically aggregate, filter, enrich, and publish tech internship listings for **India** (plus Remote) for target hiring cycles (e.g. Summer 2027, Fall 2026).
- **Core Strategy**: Read public ATS job feeds directly (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workday, SmartRecruiters, Internshala, Naukri, etc.), normalize jobs to a unified `Job` schema, deduplicate, enrich posting text, and generate output formats via GitHub Actions on a schedule.
- **De-Americanized Scope**: All legacy US visa/H-1B/F-1 sponsorship tracking files (`h1b.py`, `sponsorship.py`, `build_h1b.py`, `data/h1b.json`) have been removed. Do **not** re-introduce US-specific visa/sponsorship logic.

## 3. Key Operational Rules & Constraints

1. **Connector Isolation & Unstable Feed Disabling**:
   - Connector fetch functions are registered in `CONNECTORS` inside `src/intern_engine/pipeline.py`.
   - Direct ATS: Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, SmartRecruiters, Workable, Workday, Breezy, Recruitee, Rippling, Eightfold, Oracle.

   - India Portals: Internshala, Naukri, Wellfound. Unstable or unwanted aggregators (Unstop, Instahyre, LinkedIn, Indeed) are disabled from `pipeline.py`'s `CONNECTORS` map.
   - Never add blocking network calls to main loops. One failing company feed must never crash the run (wrap in isolated error handlers).

2. **Deduplication & ID Structure**:
   - Job IDs use `<ats_source>:<company_slug>:<external_id>`.
   - Primary deduplication is handled by `_dedup()` in `pipeline.py` using `(company, normalized_title)`.

3. **Regional & Cycle Filtering**:
   - Configured via `data/config.json`. Region matching uses `filters.region_ok()` with strict Option A logic: accepts physical India locations, verified India/Global remote roles, and Indian platform postings, while strictly rejecting foreign remote roles (e.g. Poland, UK, Hungary, US major cities).
   - Explicit seasons in job titles or descriptions (e.g. "Summer 2027") override inferred seasons. Inferred seasons from posting dates are sticky once recorded.

4. **Testing Before Committing**:
   - Always run `python -m pytest` to verify all unit tests pass before completing changes.

## 4. Instructions for Future AI Sessions

- **Context Awareness**: Assume the scope is strictly **India & Remote tech internships**.
- **No Hallucinated Execution**: Distinguish clearly between local background command execution (`python run.py update`) and GitHub Actions remote CI workflows.
- **Maintain Test Hygiene**: Ensure changes do not break existing test coverage in `tests/`.
- **Execution Location**: Always run CI or full scraper processes on GitHub's servers (e.g., via `gh workflow run`), never locally on the user's machine, to protect their IP. Only run it locally if the user explicitly asks you to do so.
